## Introduction

The Notes App is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It utilizes Vite as the development tool and Firebase as the backend for storing notes. The app also relies on various dependencies like Showdown and React-MDE to enhance the user experience.

## Installation

Before you begin, ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your system.

### Vite

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a fast build tool that provides instant server start and fast building capabilities. To set up Vite for your Notes App, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root folder of your Notes App project.
3. Install Vite globally by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g create-vite
```

4. Create a new Vite project by running the command:

```bash
create-vite
```

5. Follow the on-screen prompts and select the appropriate options for your project.

### Firebase

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is a popular backend-as-a-service platform provided by Google. It offers a range of services, including real-time databases, authentication, storage, and more. To integrate Firebase with your Notes App, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. Navigate to the "Authentication" section and enable the authentication method you prefer for your app (e.g., Email/Password, Google, etc.).
3. In the "Database" section, create a new Firestore database to store your notes.
4. Obtain your Firebase configuration settings, which include your API key, project ID, and other necessary credentials.

### Dependencies

The Notes App relies on the following dependencies:

- [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown): A JavaScript Markdown to HTML converter for rendering notes in HTML format.
- [React-MDE](https://github.com/andrerpena/react-mde): A fully-featured Markdown editor for React applications.

To install these dependencies, run the following command in your project's root folder:

```bash
npm install showdown react-mde
```

Congratulations! You have successfully set up Vite, Firebase, and installed the required dependencies for your Notes App.
